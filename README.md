# MatrixCalc

A graphical matrix calculator in Java.

## Roadmap
 * Load/write matrices from/to `.mtx` files
 * Create matrices on-the-fly in a graphical interface
 * The UI will present at most 2 matrices on which the operations will be done
 * Creating identity matrix in arbitrary size
 * Scale matrix by an arbitrary scalar
 * Add, substract matrices
 * Calculate transpose, dimension, rank and **determinant**
