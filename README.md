A graphical **matrix calculator** app written in *Java*.

## Roadmap
 * Load matrices from `.mtx` files
 * Write matrices to `.mtx` files
 * Create matrices in the app with a graphical interface
 * The UI will present
  * multiple matrices on which the operations will be done
  * interface for the operation
  * as well as a result matrix
 * Create identity matrix in arbitrary size
 * Scale matrix by an arbitrary scalar
 * Add, substract matrices
 * Calculate transpose, dimension, rank and **determinant.**
